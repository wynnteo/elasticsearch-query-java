# Syncing MySQL with Elasticsearch using Logstash

In this tutorial, we’ll demonstrate how to use Logstash to sync data from MySQL to Elasticsearch. Logstash is a powerful data processing pipeline that enables you to ingest data from various sources, transform it, and then send it to your desired destination, such as Elasticsearch.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure we have the following:

- MySQL is installed and running with a database containing the data we want to sync.
- Elasticsearch is installed and running.
- Docker is installed and running.
